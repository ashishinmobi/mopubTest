# mopubTest

Context: Current Media is using MoPub as mediation. Our adapter class isn't being called, despite custom event name and data being correctly configured on MoPub dashboard.


Can you please assist in creating a lock screen app that uses MoPub mediation? The workflow we would like to test is the following:

1) When the user turns off screen, MoPub interstitial request should go out to InMobi. 
2) InMobi Interstitial Ad gets loaded
3) When the user turns on screen, MoPub should then show the ad on the lock screen. 

You can use this MoPub interstital ad unit: 397ad5cfc2474cebbab004aadd68192f
Mopub banner ad unit : 1eb8e147d56c489b9ca1e6c4aceb4941
